## Ethical statement

<!--https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/prepare-an-article#8-->

<!--Any experimental work with humans or animals must include a statement that the Ethical-->
<!--Committee of the institution in which the work was done has approved the work. This-->
<!--includes research which uses samples obtained through routine diagnostic procedures or-->
<!--treatments. For human work we also require a statement regarding informed consent.-->

<!--We will not accept articles in which the ethical aspects are open to doubt, and-->
<!--encourage all authors to consult the relevant EQUATOR guidelines for reporting-->
<!--experiments involving humans or animals.-->
