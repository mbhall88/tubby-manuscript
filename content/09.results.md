## Results

<!--https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/prepare-an-article#6-->

<!--Please organise your Results section with enough subheadings to allow readers to gain a-->
<!--clear picture of the work. The section should indicate the key questions being-->
<!--addressed, the outcomes of experiments, and any interpretation of these results. You may-->
<!--include here any figures and tables within the body of the text to assist Editors and-->
<!--reviewers in assessing the work more easily.-->

<!--To help Editors and reviewers assess the reproducibility of your work, include the-->
<!--number of times your experiment was repeated and the type of result shown (mean, median,-->
<!--representative, etc.). If results are expressed as percentages, the absolute value-->
<!--corresponding to 100% should be stated. Indicate the variability of the results-->
<!--statistically wherever possible; when error terms are given, state the measure of-->
<!--dispersion and the number of observations. Specify the statistical techniques you used,-->
<!--and where necessary either describe the technique or provide a reference.-->
